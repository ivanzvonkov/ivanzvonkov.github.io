            <p style="text-align: left;">
                I am a Machine Learning Engineer at NASA Harvest where I work 
                on scaling up machine learning research relating to agriculture and food security.
                I am also working towards an M.S. in Computer Science at the University of Maryland.
                <br><br>
                Before joining NASA Harvest, I worked at a fintech start-up developing machine learning 
                and data science solutions for automating trade finance document processing.
                I completed a BEng in Software Engineering at the University of Western Ontario where 
                I developed an award-winning forest fire forecasting project for my capstone.
